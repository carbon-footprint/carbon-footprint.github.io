"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

J. R. R. Tolkien, *The Lord of the Rings*

On a warm February morning, with smog in the air, we set out on our grand adventure!

The smoke haze reminds us of why we're travelling by land and not air.
Journeying from Melbourne to Brisbane by train over the next few days we leave Southern Cross train station at 8:56&nbsp;am.
The train has been delayed!
But, no matter, a half hour delay to a twelve-hour trip is wholly insignificant.

After we board several pleasantries are announced over the intercom.
We find out there are a range of menu items available in the Buffet carriage and that one of our many stops will be "The Rock" -- definitely one to look forward to.
We are also treated to a detailed list of the prohibited activities on board the train (smoking, drinking excessively, etc.) and their associated penalties.
It's hard not to wonder what past events have made this announcement a necessity.

In the days before our journey we had discussed that six books each would probably tide us over.
We've brought a number of books for the journey, but none of our selections compare to the Tin Tin comic being read by a child two seats over.
We've been outdone.

After a slow start getting out of the city it isn't long before the country starts to roll past the windows. 
Unfortunately it seems that internet access and electricity may be in short supply.
Good thing we brought those books...

Goodbye for now, we're off to the Buffet carriage to check out our favourite menu item -- the "Posh ham and cheese toastie".
