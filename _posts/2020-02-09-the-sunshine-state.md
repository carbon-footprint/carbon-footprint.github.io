"Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet."

[Arrival in Brisbane: 4:06 a.m.]

<br>

Hello dear readers. The party continues.

Well we've made it to Brisbane, arriving in the early hours of the morning.
Managing to get some Zs on the train, we wake up as the carriages rattle through the sparsely populated outskirts of Brisbane.
It is pitch black on Roma Street at 4 a.m. as we walk out of the station.
Up and down the street, there's not another a soul to be seen.
No cabs either, it seems.
We go for a walk in search of a taxi, picking a likely corner not far from the station, and soon land a big ol' fish: the maxi-cab.
Before we know it we're speeding towards our accommodation in Brisbane's West End and fumbling with the keys to our apartment.
Luggage dumped at the door, we hit the hay and go back to sleep.
The last thing we hear is the birdsong welcoming in the dawn.

It's mid-morning now and we're off to breakfast.
We find a cafe close to the river that has plant-based meals.
The Sunshine State welcomes us into its loving arms with a torrential downpour!
Our shoes are soaked through as we squelch into the cafe and sit down to eat.
An apocryphal quote from Albert Einstein frames the menu.
There's also the word *Decaf* listed specifically on the menu, and no shortage of panic as it's found to taste indistinguishable from ordinary coffee.
Later on, while paying at the counter...

"How was the decaf?" <br/>
"With no hint of exaggeration, let us say it was OUTSTANDING." <br/>
"Good. The first one I ever made did not taste like that."

Damn fine coffee.

The journey is a resounding success!
Nothing gives you the impression of the expanse of this great land like travelling by rail, one truly feels the distance covered.
There's room to pack whatever you may need, and to stretch your legs whenever you might like.
You're not cramming your stuff (and self) into a tight space, wondering if your bag is just slightly too heavy to carry on.
There's no check in or metal detectors to worry about.
You don't even have to get to the airport!
And along the way there are only the comforting percussive sounds of the railway rather than the persistent roar of the jet engines.

Though the length of trip may seem daunting, so far we've found that hours will easily pass by on the train.
We feel that our travels here have been a rich experience, the pace allowing us to adapt to changes in the country as we go.
If we'd taken the plane, we'd probably only have seen flight attendants and an eight dollar packet of peanuts.

On our travels we've met a broad range of characters.
And it is a melancholy truth that we can't tell all their stories.
