"We've had one, yes. But what about second breakfast?"

*Pippin* played by Billy Boyd in Peter Jackson's *The Fellowship of the Ring*

[Departure from Brisbane: 2:44 p.m.]

<br/>

Hi all,

So after a brief stay in the capital of NSW, we are on the road again (and by "road", we mean rail).
Planned arrival in Brisbane: 3:53 a.m.
We had a wonderful day in Sydney which started in a way fit for any hobbit -- with two breakfasts.

Our second breakfast was close to our morning destination, the Art Gallery of NSW, where we visited the [Japan Supernatural](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/supernatural/) exhibition.
What a fantastic collection!
Rooms and rooms of illustrations depicting the many and varied supernatural creatures of Japanese folklore -- the monsters collectively known as [Y≈çkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai).

We learned about the princess who was whisked away to a dimension of hell, where she was imprisoned by a demon.
Growing old in its dungeon, she was stumbled upon by a wayward warrior who stole her arm, as proof of his discovery.
Returning to the physical world, now as a demon herself, she wins an interview with the warrior and persuades him to show her the rotten arm by appealing to his vanity.
As soon as it is produced, she snatches it up and runs away, reunited with her erstwhile limb at long last!

Another tale tells of a racoon-dog demon who, taking pity upon a woodcutter, turns itself into a teapot for his use.
After a time the teapot comes into possession of a monk who carefully and regularly polishes and cleans it.
The demon doens't much like being cleaned though and -- to the monk's surprise -- turns back into a racoon-dog, ending its time as a teapot!

There really were too many fantastical stories to recall them all.
After taking everything in at the gallery we set out in search of lunch at Circular Quay and by chance ran into a colleage from Sydney!

"Any recommendations for lunch nearby?"<br/>
"No, not around here. It's not like Melbourne where you can get good food on every street corner."

Indeed, it is not.

A brief ride on Sydney's new light rail takes us back to our accomodation to collect our bags and a short walk to the station in the pouring rain leaves us quite damp while we wait for the train service to Brisbane.

And so it is with a mind full of fantasy and wonder that we say farewell to this drizzly state capital and its colonial architecture.
Stay tuned.
