"A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to."

*Gandalf the Grey* played by Ian McKellen in Peter Jackson's *The Fellowship of the Ring*

[Arrival in Sydney: 9:13 p.m.]

Hey everyone.

We've been excited to hear there has been some interest in this project on social media today!
First, for those who missed it, there is a [Data and References](https://carbon-footprint.github.io/references/) page on this website, which includes all the numbers were used to make the graph of carbon emissions above.
By far our favourite response from our devoted readers so far has been the following meme.

Keep the comments coming!

In the end we arrvied in Sydney about 90 minutes late after delays due to signalling and weather.
Though the landscape on the way was often brown and dry, Sydney is wet.
Today there was 60 mm of rainfall and tomorrow 120 to 200 mmm of rain is expected to fall over the city.

On the train, time flew by as we laughed, cried, listened to music, read books, and -- most importantly -- completed the cryptic crossword from the Saturday Paper.
Take that Mungo!
(Not really.
There were three words we couldn't get out but solved with the help of the internet.
We wrote these in using lowercase letters, but everything in capitals is by us -- we promise!
Our knowledge of Greek goddesses, Italian wines, and Slovenian lakes was lacking.)

For the physics fans out there, our favourite clues were:
* 15d. Chooses Corbett and Barker -- although they're small and negative (9) *ELECT-RONS*
* 9d. Measure of the way radiation decays in some elements -- lithium and iron? (4-4) *HALF-LI-FE*

(No one tell Mungo MacCallum but radiation ITSELF doesn't decay but rather it is unstable atoms themselves that decay, giving off ionising radiation in the process.)

On crossing the bridge over the Murray River, we were welcomed into the Premier State with the following message. 
Thank you, people of New South Wales.

As there were no passengers to pick up at "The Rock" today, we sadly passed the town by without stopping.
Alright then "The Rock", keep your secrets.
For now...

We're off to bed now, excited to spend a morning in Sydney before we do it all again tomorrow!
We remain in high spirits.
