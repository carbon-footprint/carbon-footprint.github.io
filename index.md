Every time we use energy produced through the burning of fossil fuels, there is a cost to the environment.
This is part of our [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint).

We developed [code](https://github.com/carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint) to calculate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for travel by car, train, and plane.
The results show that for a trip to Brisbane the train is the most environmentally-friendly mode of transportation.

Based on this analysis we chose to travel by train from Melbourne to Brisbane to attend [ICONN 2020](https://www.iconn2020.com).
See the blog posts below for updates on our journey.
