Every time we use energy that was produced through the burning of fossil fuels, there is a cost to the environment.
This is known as our carbon footprint.

We developed [code](https://github.com/carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint) to calculate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for journeys by car, train, and plane.
The results show that the train is the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation.

Based on this analysis we chose to travel by train from Melbourne to Brisbane to attend [ICONN 2020](https://www.iconn2020.com).
